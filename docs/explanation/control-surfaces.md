# Control Surfaces

This document covers Typio's user-facing control surfaces:

- `typio-settings`
- the tray menu
- future settings widgets or shell integrations

It replaces the older split between UI-only notes and settings-center config flow notes. The goal is to keep information architecture, state ownership, and editing rules in one place.

The broader ownership model for persisted config, runtime state, and staged edits is defined in [Config & Runtime Ownership](config-runtime-ownership.md).

## Scope

Control surfaces have two jobs:

- present runtime state coming from the `typio` daemon
- let the user edit persistent configuration safely

They must not become a second source of truth for runtime or config state.

## Sources Of Truth

The canonical ownership model is defined in [Config & Runtime Ownership](config-runtime-ownership.md). Control-surface code should not redefine those domains locally.

For UI work, the practical rules are:

- runtime state must come from the daemon, not from client-side filesystem guesses
- if a runtime selection is unknown, keep the widget unselected instead of guessing a fallback entry
- persistent edits must start from the daemon's current `ConfigText`
- widget state is never authoritative by itself
- programmatic refresh must not overwrite newer local staged edits
- selector widgets should prefer the shared `SettingsStateBinding` model over bespoke sync logic

## Editing Model

`typio-settings` now uses an instant-apply model with background autosave:

1. wait for the first `ConfigText` from the status bus
2. seed the local stage from that config text
3. let user edits update widget state immediately
4. mirror the edited form back into the staged full config text
5. schedule an automatic `SetConfigText` submission after a short debounce

Required invariants:

- Before the first successful seed, widget initialization must not write staged config.
- During programmatic refresh, all change handlers must be suppressed.
- UI response must be immediate; persistence is allowed a short async debounce.
- Only one config write may be in flight at a time.
- If the user edits again while a write is in flight, the newest staged config must win once the current write finishes.
- Old daemon replies must not overwrite newer local staged edits.
- Default values belong to schema application and daemon-side config reload, not to settings-surface startup.

## Known Failure Pattern

This class of bug is easy to reintroduce:

1. the control surface starts before the daemon is ready
2. widget setup emits change signals
3. the UI writes a local stage based on widget defaults
4. the user edits one unrelated setting
5. the whole polluted staged config overwrites unrelated daemon config

This is how a Rime-schema edit can accidentally reset `default_engine` or other top-level keys.

## Information Architecture

- Top-level navigation should represent stable product areas such as `Appearance`, `Input engines`, and `Shortcuts`.
- Avoid mixing categories and concrete instances in the same navigation layer.
- Engine/backend/model choices belong in dropdowns, not in extra tabs.
- Use at most two navigation levels in the control center.
- Keyboard and voice are engine categories, not competing alternatives. The settings panel should show them as separate sections in the same product area, because they can be active at the same time.

## Visual Hierarchy

- Follow the native GTK/GNOME preference-window pattern instead of building a dialog-like form workflow.
- Prefer one clear content column with grouped sections over nested sidebars or multiple competing surfaces.
- Use the header bar for navigation only; avoid putting `Apply` / `Cancel` actions in the title bar.
- Runtime problems should be subtle inline feedback and should only be shown for real failures. Successful saves and retries stay silent.
- Use page titles sparingly; do not repeat obvious navigation labels.
- Prefer spacing and grouping over extra frames or helper text.
- Let one container own the shape language. In practice, the outer panel owns rounded corners and inner list rows stay flat, matching a boxed-list style.

## Component Rules

- Header-bar stack switchers are for tightly related sibling views only.
- Preference rows should use native widgets directly; avoid wrapping standard controls in extra decorative containers.
- Buttons are for explicit actions, not for passive refreshes.
- Avoid locking switches or dropdowns while async saves are in flight.
- Use optimistic UI with short debounced autosave: `switch` / dropdown-style controls can use a shorter delay than spin/text inputs.
- Remove maintenance actions from the main flow if the daemon can refresh itself or if the action has no meaningful user decision attached. A manual Rime deployment action is an exception because user edits under the Rime data directory are out-of-band source changes and require an explicit rebuild of generated `build/*.yaml` artifacts.

## Rime Schema Discovery

Both the tray menu and the settings panel read the active engine's generic surface (`TypioEngineSurfaceOps`, declared in `libtypio`'s `typio/abi/engine.h`). The Rime engine plugin exposes a `schema` property whose enum choices are the installed schemas, so neither surface needs Rime-specific code; the same plumbing works for any future engine that exposes settings or actions. In `typio-settings`, schema option refresh flows through the selector binding layer rather than one-off widget code.

Implementation locations:

- `typio-settings` repository — the GTK settings panel
- `typio-wayland` repository (`src/tray/`) — the tray control surface
- `libtypio` repository — shared config and schema helpers consumed by both surfaces

## Tray Menu Rules

- The main engine list should contain keyboard engines only.
- Rime schema choices may appear under a Rime-specific submenu because they are part of day-to-day keyboard usage.
- Voice controls should stay out of the tray unless they become a primary frequent action.
- The tray icon should represent keyboard-engine status, because keyboard engines own composition and status icons. Voice state may appear in tooltip or structured status surfaces, but it must not replace the keyboard icon.

## Documentation And Tests

Any change to settings-surface behavior should update:

- this document, if source-of-truth or editing rules change
- user documentation, if visible UI or behavior changes
- regression tests for startup seeding, dirty-state handling, and config apply

Minimum regression coverage to keep:

- startup before the daemon appears must not dirty the local stage
- programmatic dropdown refresh must not rewrite config
- changing one field must not rewrite unrelated top-level settings
- fast repeated switch toggles must preserve the newest local state
- delayed daemon replies must not overwrite newer staged edits
- Rime and voice settings must round-trip through daemon `ConfigText`
